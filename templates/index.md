# Welcome to Willies Workshop!

## Some Crap I been doin'

### Computer Stuff

#### jumpstat
[jumpstat](https://jumpstat.williesworkshop.net) is a site I've been working on lately. 

It collects data about the Jump Bike electric bike share system in Sacramento and tries to give
a little insight into how many bikes are on the system and how they're used.

#### Shotglass2 web site starter
Shotglass2 is my second version of a web site starter kit I made up and put on [github](https://github.com/wleddy/shotglass2/). I
wanted a way to quickly put up a little web site for myself or friends. It's created using python and the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) 
web framework. Makes a site with a basic database, Users, Roles etc and a contact form
with email. 

I made this site with it. Basically able to put up a site in 5 minutes.

Shotglass2 adds the ability to host multiple sites from the same installation. It's also easier to override the layout of the basic
Shotglass2 site without modifying the underlying code.

It also has a much nicer mobile responsive layout using the w3.css library from [w3schools.com](http://w3schools.com/w3css/)

#### Inventory System

I've created a simple inventory system principally to track bike parts used in the North Natomas Jibe [Bike Doc](http://jibe.org/bike/bike-doc) program.

The system is a web app based on shotglass (what else?).
